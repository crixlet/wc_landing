Below is an expanded, highly detailed specification that can be used as a prompt for a design and development AI tool. This spec drills into every section and feature of the landing page, providing explicit guidelines for content, layout, style, interactions, and assets. It’s written as if you’ll feed it directly into another AI-driven creation tool to guide it in producing each module.

# Comprehensive Landing Page Specification

## Background & Context

**Brand Concept**:  
Wearable Challenge turns the solitary world of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data into a connected community experience. Users join teams to stay accountable, measure daily progress, and benefit from expert coaching in a welcoming group format. The landing page should convey the idea that success doesn’t come from data alone—but from people supporting each other, much like Strava fosters community and accountability among athletes.

**Core Themes**:  
- Community-driven progress (like Strava’s leaderboards, community posts)  
- Accountability through team-based challenges (inspired by Ladder’s model)  
- Encouragement and guidance from coaches and peers  
- Turning dry CGM data into enjoyable, game-like engagement

**Tone & Voice**:  
- Encouraging, positive, and friendly  
- Confident yet approachable, reflecting a premium but not exclusive brand  
- Focus on simplicity, progress, and the daily journey  

**Key Objectives of the Landing Page**:  
1. Introduce the concept: CGM accountability through a social, team-based platform.  
2. Highlight benefits, features, and community-driven aspects.  
3. Show social proof, credibility, and results.  
4. Drive users to sign up or learn more (primary CTA: “Get Started Now”).

  - Right side: A floating iPhone mockup showcasing the Wearable Challenge app interface: visible community feed, team check-ins, and progress metrics.  
  - The hero image and phone mockup should blend seamlessly with a subtle gradient overlay for readability.

**Design & Style Guidelines**:  
- Full-width layout with a clean background (light-to-dark subtle gradient) to ensure contrast and text legibility.  
- Lifestyle image: natural lighting, no staged or overly stock-like photos. Consider diverse representation (e.g., a person of color, a realistic home setting).  
- The floating iPhone should show a real screenshot from the app’s UI that includes:  
  - A team feed post (e.g., “John logged a healthy breakfast!”)  
  - A progress bar or points tally  
  - A friendly comment or “like” interaction to convey activity and engagement

## Brand Voice & Copy Guidelines

- Tone: Encouraging, community-oriented, progress-driven.  
- Language: Clear, simple, and direct. Avoid technical jargon.  
- Always emphasize community and the human aspect rather than the data alone.  
- Keep copy concise—short paragraphs, bullet points, and scannable sections.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Include a sticky header with the brand logo and a simple navigation menu for returning visitors (e.g., “Overview,” “Features,” “Community,” “Get Started”).  
- Ensure CTAs appear multiple times across the page (hero, mid-page, final push).  
- Deploy a responsive framework (like Tailwind or a custom CSS system) and ensure cross-browser compatibility.  
- Use a web-safe or easily loadable font stack for performance if custom fonts are used, ensure font files are optimized.
